# Project: Betwork

## Project Description

Betwork is a peer to peer sports betting social application. Currently there are features for viewing, liking, and commenting on posts. There is also some mocks for a 'Bets' page in the navgiation. We are in the early stages of prototyping this out for just a handful (let's say 20) friends to play around with for the upcoming NBA season.

Right now, we are only focusing on NBA as the sport in which you can bet.

We are currently also thinking about points instead of money. Essentially, the users db in appwrite has a balance field that tracks the user's points. We will update this every week to reset to 1k points. There will basically be weekly winners.

## Tech Stack
