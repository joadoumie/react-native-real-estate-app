# Project: Betwork

## Project Description

Betwork is a peer to peer sports betting social application. Currently there are features for viewing, liking, and commenting on posts. There is also some mocks for a 'Bets' page in the navgiation. We are in the early stages of prototyping this out for just a handful (let's say 20) friends to play around with for the upcoming NBA season.

Right now, we are only focusing on NBA as the sport in which you can bet.
